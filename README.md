# tmp-share

Temporary stuff I am working on and want to share with others for
collaboration. Don't expect anything stable nor permanent from this repo...

## Some of the more interesting examples:

* [3D volume slicer](./3D-slices.ipynb): Interactive slicer for 3D volumes in
  matplotlib.
* [interp_cubic_spline_3d](./interp_cubic_spline_3d.py): 3D cubic spline
  interpolation routine, taking the same input parameters (first three) as
  `scipy.interpolate.interpn`.
* [Running Matlab in Jupyter](./RunningMatlabInJupyter.ipynb)
* [1D next/previous interpolation](./interp1d-left-right.ipynb)
* [Runtime comparison of 8 different methods](./multiply_volume.ipynb)
